# MyTunes Landing Page

> Landing page modeled after iTunes page. This was used in a YouTube tutorial by Traversy Media

I made some modifications to the code Brad wrote to make it more visually appealing (to me). Enjoy!

To launch locally, just open `dist/index.html`

Also, there is a git hook for auto-deploying on push which can be useful. Just run `npm run hook` to enable that.
